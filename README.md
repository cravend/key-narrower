Key Narrower
============

This is a set of simple utility functions designed to help make accessing
objects in Typescript easier and safer.

Installing
----------

Install via your favorite package manager:

```shell
yarn add key-narrower
```

Usage
-----

All functions have built-in JSDoc documentation. As this is primarily useful in 
Typescript projects, try using your editor's type sensing functionality to see
how the functions narrow the types of your variables.

Contributing
------------

Pull requests are welcome! To get started with this project, run:

```shell
yarn install && yarn run husky install

<sup>if anyone knows the Yarn Berry equivalent of `yarn prepare`,
please let me know ;)</sup>
