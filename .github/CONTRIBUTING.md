Guidelines to Contributing
==========================
I welcome any and all contributions! You're free to open an [issue](https://github.com/cravend/key-narrower/issues/new) or [PR](https://github.com/cravend/key-narrower/compare) if you see something that could help improve the project. All I ask is that you don't get offended if I can't or won't accept something. :-)
